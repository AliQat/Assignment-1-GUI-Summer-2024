                    VTuber or virtual youtubers and content creators are a fairly new
                    concept and I have contributed to that community when I was
                    commissioned to draw a base for a model to be used in the creation
                    of a virtual youtuber.

                    cigarette. That is what my client told me and who am I to argue? I did this for free as I enjoyed
                    doing it and the character is pleasing to stare at.
